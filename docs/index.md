# Playx Navigation

**Playx Navigation** is a navigation package for Flutter built on top of
[`go_router`](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router). It keeps everything go_router
gives you and adds what larger apps keep rebuilding by hand:

- a **lifecycle for every page** (`onEnter`, `onHidden`, `onReEnter`, `onExit`) that behaves
  correctly with shell routes, stacked pages, deep links, replace and the browser's back button;
- **page-scoped state**: controllers that are created per page, can't overwrite each other, and
  are disposed when the page goes away, with optional GetX interop;
- **web-friendly navigation**: back to the parent when there is nothing to pop, `popUntil`,
  breadcrumbs, and browser tab titles;
- **navigation without a `BuildContext`**, route guards, error handling for slow or failing page
  setup, and loading states without blank frames.

```dart
PlayxRoute<JobDetailsController>(
  path: ':id',
  breadcrumb: (context, state) => 'Job #${state.pathParameters['id']}',
  controller: (context, state) => JobDetailsController(state.intPathParam('id')!),
  disposeController: (controller) => controller.onClose(),
  builder: (context, state) => const JobDetailsView(),
)

class JobDetailsView extends PlayxView<JobDetailsController> {
  const JobDetailsView({super.key});

  @override
  Widget buildView(BuildContext context, JobDetailsController controller) {
    return Scaffold(body: Text(controller.title));
  }
}
```
